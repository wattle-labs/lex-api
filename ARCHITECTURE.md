# Architecture Explanation

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Interfaces Layer

**Location:** `src/models/interfaces/`

**What it does:** Defines TypeScript types that represent data structures.

**Rationale:**

- Provides type safety through TypeScript
- Serves as a contract for data structures
- Makes refactoring safer by catching type errors early
- Separates data structure definition from implementation details

### 2. Schemas Layer

**Location:** `src/models/schemas/`

**What it does:** Defines MongoDB schema structure using Mongoose.

**Rationale:**

- Handles database-specific validation rules
- Defines relationships between collections
- Sets up pre/post hooks for database operations
- Separates database structure from business logic

### 3. Models Layer

**Location:** `src/models/*.model.ts`

**What it does:** Connects schemas to MongoDB collections.

**Rationale:**

- Creates the actual MongoDB model objects
- Provides a clean interface for repositories to use
- Centralizes model registration and configuration
- Allows for model-specific methods if needed

### 4. Repositories Layer

**Location:** `src/repositories/`

**What it does:** Handles all data access operations.

**Rationale:**

- Abstracts database operations behind a clean interface
- Standardizes CRUD operations across all data types
- Makes it easy to switch database implementations if needed
- Isolates database query logic from business logic
- Follows the Repository pattern for data access

### 5. Services Layer

**Location:** `src/services/`

**What it does:** Contains business logic and uses repositories.

**Rationale:**

- Centralizes business rules and domain logic
- Orchestrates calls to one or more repositories
- Adds non-database related functionality
- Makes business logic testable without database dependencies
- Keeps controllers thin and focused on HTTP concerns

### 6. Controllers Layer

**Location:** `src/controllers/`

**What it does:** Handles HTTP requests and responses.

**Rationale:**

- Translates HTTP requests into service calls
- Formats service responses into HTTP responses
- Handles HTTP-specific concerns like status codes
- Implements REST API patterns consistently

### 7. Routes Layer

**Location:** `src/routes/`

**What it does:** Defines API endpoints and connects them to controllers.

**Rationale:**

- Centralizes route definitions and documentation
- Separates routing concerns from controller logic
- Makes it easy to add middleware to specific routes
- Provides a clean structure for API versioning

## Why This Separation Matters

1. **Maintainability:** Each layer has a single responsibility, making the code easier to understand and modify.

2. **Testability:** Layers can be tested in isolation with mock dependencies.

3. **Flexibility:** Implementation details can change without affecting other layers.

4. **Scalability:** The architecture supports growth as new features are added.

5. **Consistency:** Standardized patterns make the codebase more predictable.

## Why Have Both Repositories and Services?

This might seem redundant at first, but there are good reasons:

1. **Different Concerns:** 
   - Repositories focus only on data access
   - Services focus on business logic and rules

2. **Complex Operations:**
   - Services can coordinate multiple repository calls
   - Services can implement transactions across repositories

3. **Business Rules:**
   - Services enforce business rules before data access
   - Repositories remain focused purely on database operations

4. **Reusability:**
   - Multiple services can reuse the same repository
   - Repositories provide a consistent data access layer

5. **Testing:**
   - Services can be tested with mock repositories
   - Business logic can be tested without database dependencies
